# HIRING PROCESS

The hiring process is a important function for any company. To make 
informed decisions about hiring, it is important for companies to analyse 
trends related to the process such as the number of candidates who are 
rejected, the number of interviews conducted, the types of jobs available, and the number of vacancies. This analysis can help companies determine how to effectively hire new employees.


# APPROACH:
A dataset is given which consists the information of various fields related 
to company hiring data for example: Department, Post Name,offered_salary..etc. The dataset was deeply analysed and was easy to find the insights and solve the tasks.

# INSIGHTS:
Considering the fourth task (Draw Pie Chart / Bar Graph ( or any other 
graph ) to show proportion of people working different department ?). In this we have to find how many of them are working in each department. I have created a separate column with the help of the formula
(=COUNTIF(E2:E289,"Finance Department")) which shows the count of the 
departments individually. This made the job of drawing a graph easy.

# RESULTS:
Learned how to apply formulae, draw a graph, perform statistical 
functions like AVERAGE,SUM, MEANâ€¦etc.
