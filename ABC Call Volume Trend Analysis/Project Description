Description:
In this project, you'll be diving into the world of Customer Experience (CX) analytics, specifically focusing on the inbound calling team of a company. You'll be provided with a dataset that spans 23 days and includes various details such as the agent's name and ID, the queue time (how long a customer had to wait before connecting with an agent), the time of the call, the duration of the call, and the call status (whether it was abandoned, answered, or transferred).

A Customer Experience (CX) team plays a crucial role in a company. They analyze customer feedback and data, derive insights from it, and share these insights with the rest of the organization. This team is responsible for a wide range of tasks, including managing customer experience programs, handling internal communications, mapping customer journeys, and managing customer data, among others.

In the current era, several AI-powered tools are being used to enhance customer experience. These include Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Predictive Analytics, and Intelligent Routing.

One of the key roles in a CX team is that of the customer service representative, also known as a call center agent. These agents handle various types of support, including email, inbound, outbound, and social media support.

Inbound customer support, which is the focus of this project, involves handling incoming calls from existing or prospective customers. The goal is to attract, engage, and delight customers, turning them into loyal advocates for the business.

Business Understanding:
Advertising is a crucial aspect of any business. It helps increase sales and makes the audience aware of the company's products or services. The first impressions of a business are often formed through its advertising efforts.

The target audience for businesses can be local, regional, national, or international. Various types of advertising are used to reach these audiences, including online directories, trade and technical press, radio, cinema, outdoor advertising, and national papers, magazines, and TV.

The advertising business is highly competitive, with many players bidding large amounts of money to target the same audience segment. This is where the company's analytical skills come into play. The goal is to identify those media platforms that can convert audiences into customers at a low cost.

In this project, you'll be using your analytical skills to understand the trends in the call volume of the CX team and derive valuable insights from it.
