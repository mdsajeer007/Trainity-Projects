The problem to be solved in this project by exploring the dataset of IMDB movies and extracting insights from it. The data cleaning process is performed by removing null values, dropping columns, and other necessary cleaning techniques. The analysis is focused on finding the movies with the highest profit by creating a new column and plotting the profit against budget. The top 250 movies are extracted based on their IMDb rating and the number of votes, and a new column is created to identify the top foreign language films. The best directors are identified based on their average IMDb score, and popular genres are identified based on the frequency of their occurrence. Finally, the lead actors Meryl Streep, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Brad Pitt are identified by creating new columns and filtering the data. The insights obtained from this project can help stakeholders make informed decisions about movie production and marketing.
