# OPERATION ANALYTICS AND INVESTGATING METRIC SPIKE

Operation Analytics is the process of analysing a company's overall 
operations from beginning to end to identify areas for improvement. As a Data Analyst, help them understand the data they collect and use it to make better decisions. The analysis helps the company to predict its growth or decline and optimize its workflows. Investigating metric spikes is also a critical part of this analysis to understand why certain metrics may have gone up or down.

# APPROACH:
The process of gathering information i.e by the reading the description, understanding the dataset and tasks to do. By using an IDE(DBeaver) further continued to write queries for the tasks. Created the table with SQL Query, performed the tasks, faced many errors when working, took a lot of time 
clearing those errors.

# INSIGHTS:
Considering the first task of this task which was “Calculate the number 
of jobs reviewed per hour per day for November 2020?”. First I calculated the total hours of time spent for reviewing jobs for November. Then further lead to the calculation of per day. Then per hour, it took a lot of my thinking power to complete this project.

# RESULTS:
How to proceed for a task, how to clear errors, how to check whether the output is correct. These were the things learned.
