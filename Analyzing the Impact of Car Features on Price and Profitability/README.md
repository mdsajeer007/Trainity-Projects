# Analyzing the Impact of Car Features on Price and Profitability
To analyze a dataset related to the automotive industry and use data analysis techniques such as regression analysis and market segmentation to identify the factrs that drive consumer demand for cars, and how a car manufacturer can optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand. The analysis will focus on identifying the most popular product features and market
categories among consumers, as well as the most profitable ones for the manufacturer, and using this information to develop a pricing strategy that balances consumer demand with profitability. The ultimate goal is to help the manufacturer improve its competitiveness in the market and increase its profitability over time.

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help car manufacturers optimize their pricing and product development decisions by analyzing consumer demand, market categories, and product features. By identifying which features and categories are most popular among consumers and most profitable for the manufacturer, the manufacturer can develop a pricing strategy that maximizes profitability while meeting consumer demand. The ultimate goal is to improve the manufacturer's competitiveness in the market and increase its profitability over time

# Business Problem
The business problem or question that the project aims to address is how a car manufacturer can optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand. The project will analyze a dataset related to the automotive industry to identify the factors that drive consumer demand for cars, such as product features and market categories, and use this information to develop a pricing strategy
that balances consumer demand with profitability. The ultimate goal is to help the manufacturer improve its competitiveness in the market and increase its profitability over time.

# A brief description of the dataset is given below:-

* Number of observations: 11,159
* Number of variables: 16 File type: CSV (Comma Separated Values) The variables in the dataset are: 
* Make: the make or brand of the car
* Model: the specific model of the car
* Year: the year the car was released
* Engine Fuel Type: the type of fuel used by the car (gasoline, diesel, etc.) ‚óè Engine HP: the horsepower of the car's engine
* Engine Cylinders: the number of cylinders in the car's engine
* Transmission Type: the type of transmission (automatic or manual)
* Driven_Wheels: the type of wheels driven by the car (front, rear, all)
* Number of Doors: the number of doors the car has
* Market Category: the market category the car belongs to (Luxury, Performance, etc.)
* Vehicle Size: the size of the car
* Vehicle Style: the style of the car (Sedan, Coupe, etc.)
* Highway MPG: the estimated miles per gallon the car gets on the highway
* City MPG: the estimated miles per gallon the car gets in the city
* Popularity: a ranking of the popularity of the car (based on the number of times it has been viewed on Edmunds.com)
* MSRP: the manufacturer's suggested retail price of the car

# APPROACH:
* REGRESSION ANALYSIS: 
Regression analysis is used to identify the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It helps analysts to understand how changes in one variable affect another variable and to make predictions
about future outcomes based on historical data.
* STATISTICS
Statistics method used to analyze data, draw conclusions from the data, and
make predictions about future outcomes based on probability distributions.
* DATA VISUALIZATION - EXCEL GRAPH
 Excel graphs and pivot tables are used to visualize and summarise data, making it easier to identify trends, patterns, and relationships. Graphs are used to display data visually, highlighting important patterns and trends
* DATA SUMMARIZATION AND ANALYTICS - PIVOT TABLES pivot tables are used to summarise data and perform calculations.

# Insights
1. The identification of which car features are most popular among consumers and how they affect a car's pricing and profitability.
2. Identifying which market categories are most profitable for the manufacturer and how they affect pricing and profitability.
3. The development of a pricing strategy that balances consumer demand with profitability, based on insights from regression analysis and market segmentation.
4. The identification of trends in-car features and pricing over time could help inform product development and pricing decisions.
5. The comparison of fuel efficiency across different types of cars could inform consumer purchasing decisions and product development efforts focused on fuel efficiency.
6. The development of a model to predict the price of a car based on its features and market category, could inform pricing decisions and support sales and marketing efforts.


# Results
The results of this problem would likely involve identifying key factors that drive consumer demand for cars, analyzing trends in-car features and pricing over time, and developing a pricing strategy that balances consumer demand with profitability. Through data analysis techniques such as regression analysis and market segmentation, the manufacturer could
gain insights into which product features are most popular among consumers and which are most profitable for the company. The analysis could also help identify opportunities for product development and innovation that would meet consumer demand while maximizing profitability. Ultimately, the results of this problem could help the manufacturer make informed decisions about pricing and product development that would improve its competitiveness in the market and increase its profitability over time.
