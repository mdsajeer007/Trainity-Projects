# Bank Loan Case Study
This case study aims to give you an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques that you have learnt in the EDA module, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

# A brief description of the case study and output required is given below:-
1. `application_data.csv` contains all the information of the client at the time of application. The data is about whether a client has payment difficulties.
2. `previous_application.csv` contains information about the clientâ€™s previous loan data. It contains the data whether the previous application had been Approved, Cancelled, Refused or Unused offer.
3. `columns_descrption.csv` is data dictionary which describes the meaning of the variables.

# APPROACH:
My first approach was to analyse the dataset, clean the dataset finding the blanks and missing values ,imputing the missing values with the appropriate method(mean, median ,mode).Then I tried to find the outliers in the dataset, there are some anomalies such as negative values which need either to be deleted or standardized. After all these I used pivot tables and basic charts to visualise the data. Moreover, insights were drawn based on my understandings

# INSIGHTS:
following insights were drawn based on understanding and capabilities:
* Cash loans have higher percentage as compared to revolving loan
* Most of the people have no problems regarding the loan payment
* The defaulters of cash loans are higher than the revolving ones
* Most of the labourers have problems in loan payment
